<h2>Attack</h2>
<h2>Eyesigh</h2>
<p>
    Mantis shrimps are predators which kill their prey by hitting them at high speed. 
    They have large complex eyes and are highly coloured.
</p>
<p>

Mantis shrimps have two methods of attack;
they can be <b>spearers</b> or <b>smashers</b>.
</p>
<p>They strike by rapidly unfolding and swinging their claws at the prey, 
    and can cause serious damage on victims larger than themselves.</p>
<p>Their eyes are mounted on mobile stalks and constantly move about independently of each other.
    They are considered to be the most complex eyes in the animal kingdom. </p>  
<p>The mantis shrimp has such good eyes that it can perceive both polarized light, and color vision outside the normal visual spectrum</p>
